# Stylising-Images-Using-VGG19

This project aims to provide insights on stylsing images based on neural networks like CNN. The architecture is based on VGG19 and the dataset is downloaded from kaggle (source is in the main notebook)
You need to download all the files as it is and run the 'self_trained_best.ipynb'.

The code can be used to train your own model, based on data in 'data' folder. If you are training on your won dataset, make sure to add the dataset in data folder, in such a way that all the images of a single class are in the same folder, and all these folders should be in the data folder.

The image size used in the network is (224,224) do you can use the 'resize.ipynb' to resize all your images in the dataset before training the model.
